# Draw-JuliaSet
The final project in Assembly from the Assembly Language and Embedded System course.	

Draw JuliaSet is a collaborative project that focuses on showing a Julia Set animation on the screen, accompanied by three specific requests. Firstly, the program must include more than three Operand2 formats. Secondly, it should have over three non-branch instructions. Thirdly, the 'adds r14, r0, r1' instruction is required. The drawJuliaSet function was redesigned in ARM assembly by referring to drawJuliaSet.c for the calculation method.
